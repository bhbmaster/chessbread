# Chessbread

...Under construction...

This is a chess game written in python by me to practice coding.

Python requirements 3.6 or newer (this uses python f strings so do not use an older version)

So far its only tested with Windows, later might make it tested + working in all platforms.

Package Requirements:

* pygame

Current Status:

* It draws the board is all. Nothing Special

* As features are added, I might or might not update the current status. When the product is finished, I will update this obviously.
